### Hi there, I’m **Xinyu Li (李心钰)**

I am a Ph.D. researcher studying Neuromuscular Physiology at the University of Texas at Austin, supervised by [Dr. Lisa Griffin](https://sites.edb.utexas.edu/nmus/).  

My current research focuses on two components:
1) how neuromuscular control adapts under various loading conditions, fatigue, and pain;
2) how neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can be used to restore motor unit firing patterns, muscle architecture, and functions.
