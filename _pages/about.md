I am a Ph.D. Candidate studying Neuromuscular Physiology at the University of Texas at Austin (https://sites.edb.utexas.edu/nmus/), supervised by Dr. Lisa Griffin.  

My research focuses on understanding 1) how neuromuscular control adapts under various loading conditions, fatigue, and pain, and 2) how neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can be used to restore motor unit firing patterns and muscle function.
