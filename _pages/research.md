  <h3>EMG-EMG Coherence and Electrical Stimulation</h3>
  <p>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) is a well-established rehabilitation tool known for enhancing muscle activation and promoting motor recovery. It can induce plastic changes in motor pathways, particularly within the motor cortex and corticospinal tract. By stimulating sensory pathways, NMES provides proprioceptive feedback that influences motor control programming in the central nervous system. Electromyographic (EMG) - EMG coherence is a valuable tool for assessing the frequency domain similarity of neural inputs to functionally related muscles, providing insights into shared neural drive between motor neuron pools. Investigating these effects at multiple conditions is critical for tailoring NMES-based rehabilitation protocols that align with the functional capabilities and recovery goals of individuals with neurological disorders.</p>

  <h3>Motor Unit Analysis</h3>
  <p>A motor unit is the functional unit of skeletal muscle, consisting of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it controls. When the motor neuron fires, all the muscle fibers within that unit contract together to initiate movement. Efficient motor unit firing rate and recruitment threshold are essential for restoring functional movement. In healthy individuals, fast-twitch motor units are recruited at higher force levels following Hennemanâ€™s size principle, while in those with neuromuscular impairments, these units may exhibit delayed or inefficient activation. Our study will determine whether NMES alters motor unit firing patterns during slow ramp contractions using a series of motor unit decomposition methods.</p>

  <h3>Gait Analysis in Neuropsychiatric Populations</h3>
  <p>We investigated gait stability, joint kinematics, and interlimb coordination in individuals with bipolar disorder using 3D motion capture (Vicon) and force plate to understand sensorimotor integration and cognitive-motor coupling.</p>
